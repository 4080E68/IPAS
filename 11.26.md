# 國家標準暨技術研究院 雲計算的定義

```
On-demand(需求) self-service(自助服務). A consumer(消費者) can unilaterally(單方面) provision(規定) computing capabilities(能力), such as
server time and network storage, as needed automatically(自動) without requiring(要求) human
interaction with each service provider(提供者).

Broad network(廣泛的網路) access. Capabilities(能力) are available(可用的) over the network and accessed through(通過訪問) standard
mechanisms(標準機制) that promote(促進) use by heterogeneous(異質) thin or thick client platforms (e.g.,
mobile phones, tablets, laptops(手提電腦), and workstations(工作站)).

Resource(資源) pooling(匯集). The provider’s(提供商) computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers()多個消費者
using a multi-tenant model(多租屋模型), with different physical and virtual(虛擬) resources dynamically(動態資源)
assigned and reassigned(重新分配) according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location(位置感)
independence(獨立) in that the customer generally(一般客戶) has no control or knowledge over the exact
location(精確地點) of the provided resources(提供資源) but may be able to specify location(指定位置) at a higher level of
abstraction(抽象) (e.g., country, state, or datacenter(數據中心)). Examples of resources include storage(資源包括儲存),
processing(處理中), memory, and network bandwidth(頻寬).

Rapid elasticity(快速彈性). Capabilities(能力) can be elastically provisioned(彈性配置) and released(已發布), in some cases
automatically(自動), to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the
consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can
be appropriated in any quantity at any time.

Measured service. Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging
a metering capability1 at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g.,
storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be
monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and
consumer of the utilized service.
