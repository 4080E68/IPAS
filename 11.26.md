# 國家標準暨技術研究院 雲計算的定義

```
On-demand(需求) self-service(自助服務). A consumer(消費者) can unilaterally(單方面) provision(規定) 
computing capabilities(能力), such as
server time and network storage, as needed automatically(自動) without requiring(要求) human
interaction with each service provider(提供者).

Broad network(廣泛的網路) access. Capabilities(能力) are available(可用的) 
over the network and accessed through(通過訪問) standard
mechanisms(標準機制) that promote(促進) use by heterogeneous(異質) 
thin or thick client platforms (e.g.,
mobile phones, tablets, laptops(手提電腦), and workstations(工作站)).

Resource(資源) pooling(匯集). The provider’s(提供商) computing 
resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers()多個消費者
using a multi-tenant model(多租屋模型), with different physical and virtual(虛擬) 
resources dynamically(動態資源)
assigned and reassigned(重新分配) according to consumer demand. 
There is a sense of location(位置感)
independence(獨立) in that the customer generally(一般客戶) has no control or knowledge 
over the exact
location(精確地點) of the provided resources(提供資源)
but may be able to specify location(指定位置) at a higher level of
abstraction(抽象) (e.g., country, state, or datacenter(數據中心)). 
Examples of resources include storage(資源包括儲存),
processing(處理中), memory, and network bandwidth(頻寬).

Rapid elasticity(快速彈性). Capabilities(能力) can be elastically provisioned(彈性配置) and released(已發布), 
in some cases
automatically(自動), to scale rapidly(快速擴展) outward(向外) and inward(向內) commensurate(相稱的) 
with demand. To the
consumer, the capabilities(能力) available for provisioning(空閒空間) 
often appear(經常出現) to be unlimited(無限) and can
be appropriated(能夠被挪用) in any quantity at any time(隨時有任何的數量).

Measured(實測) service. Cloud systems automatically(自動) 
control and optimize(優化) resource(資源) use by leveraging()利用資源
a metering capability1(計量能力) at some level of abstraction(某種程度的抽象) appropriate(適當)
to the type of service(服務類型) (e.g.,
storage(儲存), processing(處理中), bandwidth(頻寬), and active user accounts(活動用戶帳戶)).
Resource(資源) usage can be
monitored, controlled(受監控的), and reported(已報告), providing(提供) transparency(透明度)
for both the provider and
consumer of the utilized service(使用服務的消費者).

# 部署模型 


```
Private cloud(私有雲). The cloud infrastructure(基礎設施) is provisioned(已配置) for exclusive(獨家) 
use by a single organization(單一組織)
comprising multiple consumers(由多個消費者組成) (e.g., business units). It may be owned, managed(管理), and
operated(經營的) by the organization(組織), a third party, or some combination(組合) of them, and it may exist(可能存在)
on or off premises(外地).

Community cloud(社區雲). The cloud infrastructure(基礎設施) is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific(提供特地的人專用)
community of consumers(消費者社區) from organizations that have shared concerns(來自共同關心的組織) (e.g., mission,
security requirements(安全要求), policy(政策), and compliance considerations(合規注意事項)). It may be owned,
managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third
party, or some combination(組合) of them, and it may exist on or off premises.

Public cloud(公有雲). The cloud infrastructure(基礎設備) is provisioned for open use by the general public(提供公眾使用). 
It may beowned, managed, and operated by a business, academic(通常是營運機構和學術機構所擁有),
or government organization(政府組織), 
or some combination(一些組合) of them. 
It exists on the premises of the cloud provider(在雲提供商的現場).

Hybrid cloud(混和雲). The cloud infrastructure(基礎架構) is a composition of two or more distinct cloud
infrastructures(由兩個或多個不同的雲組成) (private(私有), community(社區), or public(公有)) 
that remain unique entities, but are bound(扔然示唯一實體但受到約束)
together by standardized(標準化) or proprietary(所有權) technology that enables data(啟用數據的技術) and 
applicationportability(應用可移植性的) (e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds).
