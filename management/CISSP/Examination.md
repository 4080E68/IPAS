Refer the following scenario when answering questions 18 through 20.

information. The datacenter includes email servers, and administrators purge
email older than six months to comply with the organization’s security policy. Access
to the datacenter is controlled, and all systems that process sensitive information are
marked. Administrators routinely back up data processed in the datacenter. They keep
a copy of the backups on site and send an unmarked copy to one of the company warehouses.
Warehouse workers organize the media by date, and they have backups from
the last 20 years. Employees work at the warehouse during the day and lock it when
they leave at night and over the weekends. Recently a theft at the warehouse resulted in
the loss of all of the offsite backup tapes. Later, copies of their data, including sensitive

internal sensitive data.
